# Positioning-drone
This is the software for the illegal drone detection and positioning system that I created for my scientific research. 
## Original idea
The idea is to build a system capable of detecting drones through images from two cameras by using object detection problems. We need to know in advance the position coordinates and optical axis directions of the two cameras. From there, calculate the drone's position. The picture below helps visualize the idea I mentioned
